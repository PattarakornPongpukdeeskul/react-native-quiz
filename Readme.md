# React Native Project with TypeScript, Yarn, and ExpoGo

This project is a React Native application built with TypeScript, managed by Yarn, and uses ExpoGo for development and testing. It serves as a starting point for developing cross-platform mobile applications.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PattarakornPongpukdeeskul/react-native-quiz
   cd your-react-native-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

   This will start Expo DevTools in your default web browser. You can run the app on an emulator, simulator, or a physical device by following the instructions in the Expo DevTools.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React Native with TypeScript setup:

- `App.tsx`: The entry point of the application.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration file.
- `package.json`: Yarn package manager configuration.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

- `yarn start`: Starts the Expo development server.
- `yarn android`: Builds and runs the Android app.
- `yarn ios`: Builds and runs the iOS app.
- `yarn test`: Launches the test runner.
